# basic-calculator

This is a basic maths calculator that I had to build for a Year 2 college assignment.
We were asked to use mainly JavaScript while structuring it with HTML and CSS.

The Javascript mainly uses strings and the eval() function for the displays and calculations, respectively.
I went a bit artsy with the CSS (odd for me, but I didn't mind it).

TO USE:
1. Download the "Calculator Assignment" folder (unzip if needed).
2. Open file marked "index.html".

TL;DR:
I made a calculator using JavaScript/HTML/CSS
